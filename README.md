## Build Instructions
### N/A :(
Or in other words: It's difficult, and working around it will be a pain.
## Build Instructions workaround (might not work)
- Download the Godot Engine Editor 4.0 Beta .NET (C#) build and make a new project in it
- Copy the "Graphics" folder from any level editor installation into the same folder as the Godot Editor .exe
- Copy the LevelEditorProjects folder from the Monsoon .zip and put it in the same folder as the Godot Editor .exe
- Copy all the files from the "Source-Code" Directory into the project's root "res://" folder /n
- Peek through the spaghetti code to see the important files that need to be supplied (by you) (you can get the important files from the official or community editor's .dir files (you need adobe director 12 for that))
- Copy said important files into the directory that the spaghetti code wants (or fake it and make them yourself) (or mess around with the spaghetti code)
- Cross your fingers and click on the "Play" button (if the editor throws a fit and wants a specific scene, select the "level_editor" scene)
- If it explodes, read the errors and try to figure out where it blew up
